# The Ray Tracer Challenge with Go

This porject is similar to my other [ray tracer repository](https://github.com/ItsAMirko/TheRayTracerChallenge). I
wanted to learn a new programming language and thought that starting with
[The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://www.amazon.de/Ray-Tracer-Challenge-Test-Driven-Renderer/dp/1680502719) by
[Jamis Buck](https://twitter.com/jamis) might be a good idea.

Don't expect me to finish the complete book but let's see how far I get this time :D
